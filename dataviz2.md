Above are the government debt ratio presented using the grid of line charts and the grid of scatter plot. Since line chart is more suitable to display continuous data over time, using line charts in the second data visualization clearly showcases the trend of government finance among different countries throughout the years. Line charts also highlight the most recent data since we use sparklines in the graph with a dot representing the ratio for the most recent year. For the third data visualization, I chose to use the grid of scatter plot to present the data. Since the data includes numerous countries, separating graphs by countries individually can increase the overall clarity. Also, comparing to line charts, scatter plots are better for illustrating the patterns in the data. When viewing the scatter plot, viewers can quickly spot anomalies or outliers. As the general government debt-to-GDP ratio is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance, it is necessary to point out outliers for countries in certain years since the views might be interested in knowing which year a country performed well/poorly while reading the graph.
