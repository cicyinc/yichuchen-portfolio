This is the government debt ratio visualized using grid of line charts.

Above are the government debt ratio presented using the grid of line charts and the grid of scatter plot. For both of the graphs, I chose red as the main color since red always represents debt while green represents equity in fiance. Speaking of the second data visualization, using line charts clearly showcases the trend of government finance among different countries throughout the years because line chart is great at displaying continuous data over time. The second data visualization also highlights the most recent data to the audience. Since we use sparklines in the graph with a dot representing the ratio for the most recent year, it can quickly draw readers' attention to the data of the most recent year.

For the third data visualization, I chose to use the grid of scatter plot to present the data. Since the data includes information from numerous countries, separating graphs by countries individually can increase the overall clarity of the visualization. Also, comparing to line charts, scatter plots are better for illustrating the patterns in the data. When viewing the scatter plot, viewers can quickly spot anomalies or outliers. Furthermore, OECD mentions that the general government debt-to-GDP ratio is a key indicator of the sustainability of government finance. Therefore, it is necessary to point out outliers for these countries in certain years in the visualization since the views might be interested in knowing which year a country performed well/poorly while reading the graph.
