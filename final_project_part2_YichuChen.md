# Part II: Wireframes, storyboards, moodboards and user research

## Wireframes and storyboard

For my Part II wireframes and storyboard, I expanded the wireframes I created in Part I by adding more supporting data and designing a visual walk-through for my final shorthand website. However, the visualizations and text are just a preview of the final version in shorthand. For some visualization such as the U.S. map, I would rely directly on Flourish or Tableau so there might be more visualizations and longer text/data facts in my final product. Also, some of the text I included are my organized thoughts for the storyboard; hence they may not appear in shorthand.

## User research protocol

### Target audience

My target audience is mainly adults who live in the United States and understand the importance of basic education. 

**Key demographics**
- Age range: 18 - 60, approximately
- Gender: Both male and female
- Location: USA, especially West Coast
- Education: From first year college students to working people

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

Based on the key demographics that I concluded, I aimed to find individuals who match the above categories. To get a broad perspective and some more diversified feedback, I decided to reach three individuals with various backgrounds. My group of interviewees includes a graduate student majoring in Data Science (male, 23, originally from San Diego), a high school teacher (female, 29, originally from Miami), and an undergrad student (female, 19, originally from Pittsburg).

### Interview script
**Introduction**

Thank you so much for agreeing to participate! I’m designing a website and here is my initial draft. Please take a look and let me know what your first impressions are. And if it’s okay, I also like to ask a few questions about your understanding of it. My goal today is to get some feedback before my final version. I hope to know what makes sense and what’s confusing so there are no wrong answers for you!

**Questions**
- Can you summarize what the storyline is telling you in just one or two sentences?
- Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?
- Does the storyline flow smoothly? 
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Is there any other information that you thought was lacking? If so, what would you have liked to see?
- Are all the visualizations appealing and clear? 
- Does the call to action resonate with you?

**Closure**

Thank you so much! I really appreciate you for taking the time to offer valueble feedback and I will incorporate the recommendations you’ve suggested into my final draft.

### Interview

**Interview #1, a graduate student majoring in Data Science**

| Question | Answer |
| ------ | ------ |
| Can you summarize what the storyline is telling you in just one or two sentences? | The students from low socio-economic status backgrounds in the United States are facing difficulties to get fundamental education. |
| Who do you think the intended audience is for the site? | U.S. citizens. |
| Does the storyline flow smoothly?  | I think it worked well. Using those surprising facts as a hook quickly drew my attention to your story. |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently? | I don't think so. I think the overall order of your story makes sense and I am interested to see your final work. |
| Is there any other information that you thought was lacking? If so, what would you have liked to see? | I understand that this is just a draft. But I would like to see more data to support your story for your final website. |
| Are all the visualizations appealing and clear? | Yes. But for the educational system graph, I think you should reverse the order of your visualization. Because you need to consider that people scroll down websites so your visual should also start from the top. |
| Does the call to action resonate with you? | Yes, it does. |

**Interview #2, a high school teacher**

| Question | Answer |
| ------ | ------ |
| Can you summarize what the storyline is telling you in just one or two sentences? | The story shows the obstacles that immigrant students are facing which includes language barriers and parental involvement. |
| Who do you think the intended audience is for the site? | Individuals who live in the United States. |
| Does the storyline flow smoothly?  | Yes. |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently? | I would pick another data visualization to support the lack of parental involvement part. Although the educational backgrounds of immigrant parents do relate to the story, there should be better data about parental involvement that can support your argument. |
| Is there any other information that you thought was lacking? If so, what would you have liked to see? | I would like to know more about how the pandemic is affecting these families. |
| Are all the visualizations appealing and clear? | Yes. One thing to notice is the choice of red color. I personally do not feel comfortable with only red color in the viz. |
| Does the call to action resonate with you? | Yes, it does. Especially since I work in the educational community, I feel really connected to your detailed suggestions. |

**Interview #3, an undergrad student**

| Question | Answer |
| ------ | ------ |
| Can you summarize what the storyline is telling you in just one or two sentences? | It shows me the educational circumstances of children from low-income immigrant families, and also potential factors that caused this situation. |
| Who do you think the intended audience is for the site? | U.S. citizens from middle class or above. |
| Does the storyline flow smoothly?  | Yes, it does. It starts with the description of the problem, and transits to the causes, and then presents the potential solutions. |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently? | Yes, it will be better if there are more specific cases included. For example, a specific community that suffers from this problem. |
| Is there any other information that you thought was lacking? If so, what would you have liked to see? | Probably your personal experience part. Would like to know more about how you connect and help those students. |
| Are all the visualizations appealing and clear? | Yes, they are clear enough for me to understand. |
| Does the call to action resonate with you? | Somehow. I believe it has something to do with personal experience. If one has relative or friend suffer from the issue, he/she will resonate more. |

### General findings from interviews

Overall, the feedback for the wireframe is quite positive. It also provided me some detailed and useful advices that I didn't think of on my audience list and visualizations.

- Target audience: I would also start to consider the economic status of my target audience. My target audience would for sure be in middle class or above.
- Story focus: The storyline needs further refinement. I would consider provide more information on the effects of the recent pandemic and will elaborate a little more on my personal story part for my final website.

### Changes I plan on implementing to my visualizations

- Visualizations: I think the feedback I got on the educational system visualization graph was very useful. I would also research more on parental involvement for immigrant students and hope  get better-supporting data.
- Color: I plan to change my theme color to dark red or dark blue instead of bright red based on the feedback I got. I think the red color that I used for my sketch was a little too bright.

### Revised wireframes

Below is my revised wireframe for my educational system visualization. For other wireframes, I plan to directly implement the revision through Flourish or Tableau on my digital visualizations.
