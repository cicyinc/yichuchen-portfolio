# Part II: Wireframes, storyboards, moodboards and user research

## Wirefames / storyboard for user feedback

## User research protocol

### Target audience
My target audience is mainly adults who live in the United States who understand the importance of basic education. 

**Key demographics**
Age range: 18 - 60, approximately
Gender: Both male and female
Location: USA, especially West Coast
Education: From first year college students to working people

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
Based on the key demographics that I concluded, I aimed to find individuals who match the above categories. To get a broad perspective and some more diversified feedback, I decided to reach three individuals with various backgrounds. My group of interviewees includes a graduate student majoring in Data Science (male, 23, originally from San Diego), a high school teacher (female, 29, originally from Miami), and an undergrad student (female, 19, based in Pittsburg).

### Interview script
**Introduction**
Thank you so much for agreeing to participate! I’m designing a website and here is my initial draft. Please take a look and let me know what your first impressions are. And if it’s okay, I also like to ask a few questions about your understanding of it. My goal today is to get some feedback before my final version. I hope to know what makes sense and what’s confusing so there are no wrong answers for you!

**Questions**
Can you summarize what the storyline is telling you in just one or two sentences?
Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?
Does the storyline flow smoothly? 
Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Is there any other information that you thought was lacking? If so, what would you have liked to see?
Are all the visualizations appealing and clear? 
Does the call to action resonate with you?

**Closure**
Thank you so much! I really appreciate you for taking the time to offer valueble feedback and I will incorporate the recommendations you’ve suggested into my final draft.
