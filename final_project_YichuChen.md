# Part I: Final project proposal

## Supporting the educational needs of students from low socio-economic status backgrounds in the United States

### Summary

For my final project, I decided to focus on the educational problem for children from low socio-economic status backgrounds in the United States. More specifically, I would focus on chidren from lower-income, immigrant families. Compared to kids in U.S.-born families, kids in immigrant families are more likely to grow up in low-income households. Many of their parents have difficulty speaking English and have low educational attainment. Due to the socioeconomic disadvantages, children from such families face limitations in education and language. In my project, I will discuss the issue in detail and I will convey the story to my audience by visualizing the data I collected from reliable sources such as the Kids Count Data Center, Urban Institute, and World Education News + Reviews. 

### Insipration

The project was initially inspired by my voluntary teaching experience last year. In 2019, I spent one year mentoring two kids from lower-income immigrant families in San Diego, California. During the time I spent with my mentees, I found that both of them were facing difficulties such as language barriers and lack of parental involvement. Therefore, I want to use this project to show my readers the obstacles in education and language that students from low socio-economic status backgrounds are facing and raise their awareness.

### Project Structure

**Story Arc**
![1](Page1.jpg)
**Hook**
- I would first present some facts to catch the readers' attention.
- For instance, "48% children in immigrant families live below 200% of the poverty threshold." 
- Data: [Kids Count Data Center](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/updates/show/244-immigrant-families-and-kids-see-economic-gains)

**Background Introduction**
- Introduce the overall education system in the United States.
- Data: [World Education News + Reviews](https://wenr.wes.org/2018/06/education-in-the-united-states-of-america)

**Compare the difference in education level between kids in U.S.-born families and kids in immigrant, lower-income families**
- Introduce the problem. 
- Data: [World Education News + Reviews](https://wenr.wes.org/2018/06/education-in-the-united-states-of-america)

**More Than Half of Kids in Immigrant Families Lived in Low-Income Households**
- Present the scale of the problem through data visualizations. 
- Data: [Kids Count Data Center](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/updates/show/189-more-than-half-of-kids-in-immigrant-families-lived-in-low-income-households-in-2016)

**Children in immigrant families in which resident parents have difficulty speaking English**
- Explain the issue through geographic and demographic factors.
- Data: [Kids Count Data Center](https://datacenter.kidscount.org/data/map/132-children-in-immigrant-families-in-which-resident-parents-have-difficulty-speaking-english?loc=1&loct=2#2/any/true/false/37/any/479/Orange/)

**COVID-19 further accelerated the problem**
- Children from low socio-economic status are less to have access to a computer and an internet connection to access the school works.
- Data: [OECD](https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/policy-responses/what-is-the-impact-of-the-covid-19-pandemic-on-immigrants-and-their-children-e7cbb7de/)
- Data: [The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/515126-covid-19-include-immigrant-families-and-children-in-relief-effort)

**My personal experience mentoring students from low socio-economic status backgrounds**
- I would share my experience, takeaways, and include pictures that I took with my students to add a personal touch to the story and convey my readers.
- What did I do to help my students? How did they grew from this experience?

**Call to action**
- What can you do to help those students? 
- Firstly, I hope to use my work to raise public awareness about the educational needs of students from low socio-economic status backgrounds.
- I would also convince my audience to take action. I will include links to non-profit child sponsorship organizations that people could donate, sponsor, and help those children in need.
- Moreover, I would recommend my audience to volunteer to be a mentor for those children in need. I will provide information and links about mentor programs around the country for their references.

### Data Sources

Below is a list of data sources I found that I will be using for the project. I mainly collected my data from the Kids Count Data Center as well as other credible resources. 

- World Education News + Reviews: https://wenr.wes.org/2018/06/education-in-the-united-states-of-america
- Kids Count Data Center: https://datacenter.kidscount.org/updates/show/189-more-than-half-of-kids-in-immigrant-families-lived-in-low-income-households-in-2016

Based on the data I found, I will reorganize the data from various sources to recreate my visualizations. I plan to pick red as my themed color and build all my visulizations based on the color. Since some of the sources here contain raw data, I also hope to condense the dataset so I can mainly focus on the recent data within the past five years. I intend on deriving my contents and visualizations from here meanwhile I will also do more research along the way. 

### Method and medium

To complete my final project, I plan to conduct further research on the educational problem for children from low socio-economic status backgrounds in the United States. After I finished collecting all the data that I plan to use, I will clean and compile it into one google sheet. On the other hand, I also hope to pitch my story and showcase my story arc to two of my friends. Similar to the procedure from the last assignment, I wish to get some feedback for my story so I can make sure that my audience can better understand my message. After hearing their feedback, I will rearrange some parts so my story could be more cohesive and engaging. 

To design my visualizations based on the data that I collected, I will mainly rely on using Flourish and Tableau. After I finished working on my visualizations, I plan to use Shorthand as the platform to present my work. I think Shorthand will be an appropriate platform to use since it allows me to showcase my data visualizations and persuasive images in a appealing way. Moreover, since I wish to use my work to increase public awareness on the current educational issues, I could also share my Shorthand links on social media after my work is finished.
