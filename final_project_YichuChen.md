# Final Project Proposal

## Children in Lower-Income, Immigrant Families

### Summary

For my final project, I decided to focus on the educational problem for children from lower-income, immigrant families in the United States. Compared to kids in U.S.-born families, kids in immigrant families are more likely to grow up in low-income households. Many of their parents have difficulty speaking English and low educational attainment. Due to the socioeconomic disadvantages, children from such families face limitations in education and language. In my project, I will discuss the issue in detail and I will convey the story to my audience by visualizing the data I collected from reliable sources such as the kids count data center, Urban Institute, and World Education News + Reviews. 

### Insipration

The project was intially inspired by one of my voluntary teaching experience. In 2019, I spent one year mentoring two kids from lower-imcome immigrant families in San Diego, California. During the time I spent with my mentees, I found that they were facing numerous acdemic difficulties in school such as language barriers

## Method and medium

To design my visualizations based on the data that I collected, I will mainly rely on using Flourish and Tableau. 

I will use Shorthand, this is also the platform I will present my work on.
