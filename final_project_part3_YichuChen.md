## Intended audience
My final data story, educational constraints of immigrant students in the united states, is aimed to target adults who live in the United States, understand the importance of education, and are in the middle class or above. They are willing to invest time in understanding the educational obstacles immigrant students are facing and make changes to help those immigrant students to have a better future. Their educational level could be from first-year college students to working people in all walks of life. 

I made a few adjustments to my target audience along the way. Originally, I considered that my target audience would be majorly U.S. citizens. As I am gathering feedback for my final story, a friend of mine advised me to consider all adults who live in the United States rather than people with citizenship. As she mentioned, there might also be people who are financially stable but still in immigrant statuses. It is crucial to target them as well because this group of people might feel more empathy towards my story. After having a clearer image of my target audience, to better attract my target audience's attention and make them want to read further, I decided to move my personal story as a hook rather than presenting it at the near end of my storyline. Also, knowing that I have the chance to share my story in class with CMU students who might be future policymakers and influencers, I decided to add potential political improvements that could be made in my call to action.

Moreover, I also made some changes to my main focus group. During part I, I wanted to focus on examining the educational issues of immigrant children from low socio-economic status backgrounds. However, when I was collecting feedbacks during part II and after, 2 of my interviewers asked me whether there is a correlation or causation between immigrant and socioeconomic status. They didn't quite understand that my target group is actually children who fall into both immigrant and low socio-economic backgrounds. Furthermore, it was quite hard to find many related data sources among kids that fall into both of the categories. Therefore, I shifted my focus group as immigrant students only while categorizing financial difficulty as one of the obstacles that block these children from pursuing basic education.

## Design decisions
During my design process, I added some additional visualizations compared to my original idea in Part I. To piece up to my story together and more smoothly, I decided to add charts such as "Number of immigrants who speak a foreign language at home" before showing immigrant children tend to have lower levels of English proficiency when they attend school. I added charts like this to serve as background information to the later message that I wanted to convey. On the other hand, I also deleted the map of immigrant parents who have difficulty speaking English that I originally had about. Although I spent hours working on the chart, I felt that this chart didn't flow well with the rest of my story. I also received similar thoughts from my peers, so I decided to delete the part to ensure all my data effectively communicate the story.

Furthermore, speaking of the types of my visualizations, I mainly chose common chart types that people are familiar with and could are easy to read including pie-charts, line graphs, and bar charts. By doing so, I hope that my visualizations are easy to interpret by the readers and can be strong supplements to my story. While most of my visualizations are in simple formats, I also redesigned some of them in more creative ways. For instance, for the chart of "more than half of immigrant children grow up in families in which parents have difficulty speaking English," I decided to go with a figure chart to represent the idea in a more interesting yet straightforward way. Although those visualizations are not as common as other ones, I still made sure that my audience can quickly absorb the information in these visualizations by asking for feedback from my peers. 

## Summary
Overall, I think working on this project was such an interesting experience. I did not only learned a lot of data visualization knowledge and tools but also got to apply the knowledge to tell a story that I am personally interested in. I also found that the user research protocol and the group discussions in class helped a lot to refine my content and improve my overall storyline. I really enjoyed working on this project and I believe that the skills and knowledge I gained in this class will certainly improve my storytelling ability in my future workplace.
