This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories With Data class at CMU.

# About Me
Hello! I am Yichu Chen and I go by Cici. I am a graduate student in the Master of Entertainment Industry Management program. I graduated from University of California San Diego with a degree of Management Science in March, 2020. I am originally from China and I currently live in Beijing. After graduating from the program, I plan to work as a marketing specialist in the entertainment industry.

# What I hope to learn
In this class, I hope to learn more about how to deliver data in useful and appealing ways to users. I am also interested in exploring different data visualization tools such as Github and Tableau. Since technical and business skills are becoming increasingly important in the workplace, I wish that I can use this class to hone my data visualization skill so I can be more prepared before stepping into the work field.
